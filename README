***FILES DESCRIPTION***

"FeynGrav.wl"
The main package file.

"Examples"
The directory contains a few files with examples.

"Rules"
The directory contains all the rules used in the package.

"Libs"
The directory contains all the libraries used by the package. Libraries describing interactions with a large number of gravitons take up a lot of space. Therefore, they are published separately and not included in the package version available on GitHub.

"Libs/FeynGravLibrariesGenerator.wl"
The package generates libraries. It is unnecessary for a user to interact with the package since libraries only need to be generated once and then published online. Because of this, the package is not very user-friendly.
