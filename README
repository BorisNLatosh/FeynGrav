FeynGrav
================

FeynGrav is a package designed to extend FeynCalc's capabilities to handle calculations involving gravitons. This document provides a short guide for installing and using the package.

Dependencies
------------
- FeynCalc version 9.3.1 or higher is required.
- FORM version 4.2 or higher is needed for generating libraries.

Installation
------------
To install FeynGrav, follow these steps:

1. Locate User Base Directory:
   - In Wolfram Mathematica, execute the "$UserBaseDirectory" command to find the User Base Directory path.

2. Copy Package Files:
   - Copy the "FeynGrav" folder to the "Applications" subdirectory within your User Base Directory.

3. Load the Package:
   - In Mathematica, load the package by executing the command "<<FeynGrav`".
   - This command will also load FeynCalc if it still needs to be loaded.

File Description
----------------
The package contains several key components:

- FeynGrav.wl:
  - The main package file that defines the core functionality of FeynGrav.

- Examples Directory:
  - Contains example files demonstrating the use of FeynGrav for various calculations.

- Rules Directory:
  - Includes all the rules applied by the package during computations.

- Libs Directory:
  - Contains the libraries used by the package. Note that libraries for interactions involving many gravitons are substantial and provided separately online, not included in the GitHub package.

- Libs/FeynGravLibrariesGenerator.wl:
  - A script for generating the necessary libraries. This script is primarily for developers and not for regular users, as libraries only need to be generated once and published online.

Usage Notes
-----------
- FeynGrav is designed to work seamlessly with FeynCalc, enhancing its capabilities to manage complex interactions involving gravitons.
- Users generally do not need to interact with the library generation script, as pre-generated libraries are available online.
- Refer to the files in the "Examples" directory for specific examples and usage patterns.

Version History
---------------
- **Version 1:**
  - Supported massless fields with spin 0, 1/2, 1, and gravity.
- **Version 2:**
  - Added support for fields with spins 0, 1/2, and 1 of arbitrary mass.
  - General relativity was included with advanced gauge fixing.
  - Implemented SU(N) Yang-Mills.
- **Version 3:**
  - Implemented a propagator for massive gravity.
  - Included Horndeski models.
  - Added axion-like coupling.
  - Introduced quadratic gravity.
