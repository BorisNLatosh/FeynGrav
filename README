***DEPENDENCIES***
FeynCalc 9.3.1 or higher is required.


***INSTALLATION**

*) Run "$UserBaseDirectory" in Wolfram Mathematica and locate the User Base Directory.
*) Copy the whole "FeynGrav" folder to "UserBaseDirectory/Applications".
*) Command "<<FeynGrav`" will load FeynGrav alongside FeynCalc in Mathematica.


***FILES DESCRIPTION***

"FeynGrav.wl"
The main package file. It contains definitions of projector operators, Nieuwenhuizen operators, and propagators. The file does not contain expression for interaction vertices, they are taken from pre-generated libraries located in "Libs".

"FeynGrav_Examples.nb"
The file contains a few examples discussed in ArXiV:2201.06812.

"FeynGrav_Examples.nb"
The file contain examples of calculations performed with FeynGrav.
The calculations are explaind in details in the corresponding ArXiV publication.
Within the file itself only brif comments are given.

"Libs"
The directory contains library files. The framework used in FeynGrav relies on certain families of tensors.

"Libs/Libraries_Generator.nb"
The file contains a script that generates libraries required for computations.
The package is provided with a pre-generated libraries up to O(\kappa^3) order in perturbation theory.
